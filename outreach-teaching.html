									<p>With state-of-the-art instrumentation like the James Webb Space Telescope, we are, for the first time in human history, able to probe the composition of exoplanet atmospheres. The most common technique to observe the composition of an exoplanet is by transit spectroscopy. Different chemical elements and molecules block more or less light, making the planet appear bigger or smaller in certain wavelengths which allows us to detect them. Unfortunately, clouds in exoplanet atmospheres can block large parts of the spectrum which covers the signature of chemical elements and molecules. Therefore, accurate cloud models are important to predict and interpret observations. Nowadays, most cloud models use 1 dimensional assumptions or heavily parameterise the clouds.<br />
										In this project you will learn how clouds form and advect in exoplanet atmospheres. You will analyse the drag forces on small and large cloud particles with the atmosphere and predict their path. The goal is to find out if size dependent advection is important for cloud models or if it can be neglected.</p>

										<p>Exoplanet transits have proven to be a powerful tool to detect exoplanets. With ever better instrumentation, we start to get more insides into their atmospheres. One important factor in the observations are clouds. Their large opacities in the visible wavelengths mute most atomic and molecular lines. Therefore, understanding how clouds impact observations is crucial to understanding observations. In Hot Jupiters, the cold night side are typically cloudy whereas the hot day sides are mostly cloud free. This uneven cloud coverage combined with their strong equatorial winds result in observations where half of the exoplanet is observed cloudy and the other half cloud free.<br />
										   In this project, the student modeled the effect of asymmetric exoplanet atmospheres on transit observations. The model was used to produce observation simulation including error bars for state-of-the-art instrumentation. </p>

									<p>On Earth, the greenhouse effect is well known and the leading cause of global warming. Sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere mostly unhindered and heats our planet. Similarly, the Earth radiates heat into outer space but at longer wavelengths. Unfortunately, the same atmospheric gases that are transparent for sunlight are opaque for Earth's heat radiation (see figure 1). The radiation gets absorbed by the atmosphere and is partially re-emitted back to the ground thus trapping the heat and raising Earth's temperature. In addition to the gas, clouds are obscuring the atmosphere and influence the local and global temperature of planets. Even though the greenhouse effect is bad for us, it can be favourable for exoplanets. The increased temperature caused by greenhouse effects can help to keep an otherwise cold planet warm enough for liquid water to exist. This includes planets outside the habitable zone which is defined as the orbital distance from a star at which the net radiation results in temperatures between the freezing and evaporation point of water (without taking the planets atmosphere into account).<br />
										In this project, the goal is to develop a model to computationally study the greenhouse effect caused by exoplanet clouds and atmosphere using a 5 layer computational model. Looking at Venus with only an atmosphere (no clouds), a Greenhouse factor smaller than unity is calculated. This would mean a cooler surface on Venus. However, this cooling is not persent in Venus. This leads to the conclusion that the model is too simplified and needs to be expended for accurate predictions.</p>

									<p>In the last decades over 4000 exoplanets have been discovered. Most of them by indirect measurements (like transits or radial velocity) but some were directly imaged. To observe exoplanets with high contrast imaging, state-of-the-art technology is required to overcome the two main challenges: high angular resolution and high contrast. One example of such an instrument is the Very Large Telescope (VLT) equipped with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE). But telescopes alone are not sufficient to find the very faint exoplanets and advanced image processing techniques have to be developed and constantly improved. The python package PynPoint contains such processing techniques to analyse observations of SPHERE. One of the core functionalities implemented into PynPoint is angular differential imaging (ADI) which helps to reduce the brightness of the host star and reveal faint companions. Recently, PynPoint was updated and now supports SPHERE/IFS data which allows to process spectral observations through spectral differential imaging (SDI). This additional information can help to improve current techniques and can be used to characterize exoplanets.<br />
										In this research angular differential imaging (ADI), spectral differential imaging (SDI) and the combinations of both methods were applied on 3 different systems using principal component analysis. This analysis gives the opporunity to subtract certain information of our data with the use of principal components. The results show that the signal to noise ratio is consistenly bigger with the combination of ADI and SDI than the methods itself. With the information of the position of the planet, properties of the orbit if the planet could me examined. These results match the values of literature, which indicates that the detection went well.</p>

									<p>In the last decades over 4000 exoplanets have been discovered. Most of them by indirect measurements (like transits or radial velocity) but some were directly imaged. To observe exoplanets with high contrast imaging, state-of-the-art technology is required to overcome the two main challenges: high angular resolution and high contrast. One example of such an instrument is the Very Large Telescope (VLT) equipped with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE). But telescopes alone are not sufficient to find the very faint exoplanets and advanced image processing techniques have to be developed and constantly improved. The python package PynPoint contains such processing techniques to analyse observations of SPHERE. One of the core functionalities implemented into PynPoint is angular differential imaging (ADI) which helps to reduce the brightness of the host star and reveal faint companions. Recently, PynPoint was updated and now supports SPHERE/IFS data which allows to process spectral observations through spectral differential imaging (SDI). This additional information can help to improve current techniques and can be used to characterize exoplanets.<br /></p>

									<p>On Earth, the greenhouse effect is well known and the leading cause of global warming. Sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere mostly unhindered and heats our planet. Similarly, the Earth radiates heat into outer space but at longer wavelengths. Unfortunately, the same atmospheric gases that are transparent for sunlight are opaque for Earth's heat radiation (see figure 1). The radiation gets absorbed by the atmosphere and is partially re-emitted back to the ground thus trapping the heat and raising Earth's temperature. Even though the greenhouse effect is bad for us, it can be favourable for exoplanets. The increased temperature caused by greenhouse effects can help to keep an otherwise cold planet warm enough for liquid water to exist. This includes planets outside the habitable zone which is defined as the orbital distance from a star at which the net radiation results in temperatures between the freezing and evaporation point of water (without taking the planets atmosphere into account). Therefore, to understand and quantify the greenhouse effect on exoplanets, it is crucial to understand which gases can influence the ground temperature of exoplanets.<br />
										An analysis of the sun’s luminosity, earth’s atmosphere, and earth’s thermal equilibrium is carried out to illuminate the nature of the atmospheric effects of greenhouse gases. This model can be extended to atmospheres with different input parameters, namely from other solar and extra-solar planets and their stellar hosts. In this research, a simplified approach to a dynamic system is taken, this means that the model accounts for single spherical stars, circular planetary orbits, a uniform, well-mixed, and homogeneous planetary atmosphere, and thermodynamic equilibrium in all parts of the system.</p>

									<p>Machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool if used correctly. The first computational models using neural networks were developed in the 1940s. Since then, the field of machine learning has steadily grown and today’s algorithms are highly advanced but also incredibly complicated. Therefore, one has to be careful applying them because each algorithm has its pros and cons. In astrophysics, the power of machine learning is slowly being discovered and machine learning is more and more used for tasks which are otherwise difficult to solve. One such task is the calculation of cloud particle opacities. Even though the calculation is well studied, it takes a long time to get precise results. Currently, linear approximations and grid interpola- tions are used to overcome this problem, but as cloud opacity calculations are non-linear, their precision is limited. Fortunately, machine learning might be able to help. Neural networks, for example, have the ability to learn non-linear dependencies and thus can predict values of non-linear functions precisely and fast.<br />
										The potential of ML (machine learning) in accelerating Mie scattering codes is researched, for the particular application of calculating radiative feedback in exoplanet atmospherers. Mie scattering theory describes the interaction between electromagnetic plane waves and particles of micro- scopic size. This model plays a role in a larger scheme to understand atmospheric exoplanet data measured during transit.</p>

									<p>Here on Earth, weather is one of the most important small talk topics, but what would we talk about if we were on an exoplanet? Thanks to state-of-the-art instrumentation and advanced modelling, we are beginning to understand the fascinating diversity of weather on planets outside of our own solar system.
										<br />Exoplanet surveys like Kepler have discovered thousands of exoplanets, meaning, we are now aware of the large diversity of exoplanets that exist in our galaxy. The next step is now to characterise these exoplanets. With current state-of-the-art technology, we are already starting to gain insights into their atmospheres, and with upcoming instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we hope to deepen our understanding of these alien worlds.
										<br />Some of the most fascinating objects discovered so far are Hot Jupiters: planets the size of Jupiter but with orbital periods of just days. These giant gas planets are tidally locked, which results in permanent day and permanent night sides. The temperature, winds and clouds on these planets are nothing like what we know from planets within our solar system and understanding them is the first step to understanding the diverse atmospheres of exoplanets.</p>

									<p> This winter school organised by the Meta futurism lab took its participants far away from the Earth. The participants were thrown onto another planet where they had to find imaginative ways to live, survive and prosper. One of the aliens they imagined can be seen in the picture. During their exploration of this new world, they were confronted with challenges which they had to overcome. In the end, the participants used their experience to create a short and interactive show.
									<br />Oriel Marshall and I were the scientific experts for this event. Our task was to answer all exoplanet and science related questions from the participants. We also asked critical questions about their ideas and tried to motivate them to further develop their solutions. All participants were highly motivated and involved in the project which made the whole day a fascinating and motivating experience. </p>
