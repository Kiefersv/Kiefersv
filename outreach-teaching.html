									<p>To get a better understanding of exoplanets and especially their atmospheres,
										theoretical models have to be created. The aim of this thesis is to simulate the cloud
										formation process on tidally locked Hot-Jupiters, which orbit a G-type host star.
										The cloud formation process was modelled for planets with equilibrium temperatures
										ranging from 2600 K to 1200 K in 200 K steps. For each planet, two mixing models
										were considered and simulated. The findings of
										this project suggest that planets with a lower equilibrium temperature have a more
										prominent nucleation formation rate, more bulk growth and therefore have more cloud
										particles. Planets with higher equilibrium temperature have clouds predominately on
										the night side, with lower equilibrium temperatures the clouds exist all around the
										planet.

									<p> In this thesis, trajectories of particles
										within an Hot Jupiter atmosphere were simulated using data of GCM simulations
										while considering changing size of the particles due to changes in the cloud particle
										properties inside the atmosphere. The results show that there are
										three well defined regions in terms of altitude, pressure and temperature inside the
										atmosphere. Particle trajectories are defined by the regions in the atmosphere where
										particles are either created (> 5.000.000m), evaporated (< 3.500.000m) or mostly
										reside in large clouds. A cloud dominated region was spotted between 3.500.000m and
										4.500.000m altitude. In lower altitude layers
										possible low pressure areas with resulting strong updrafts, downward trajectories for
										evaporating particles and gyres were identified. Particle trajectories at high altitudes
										have a strong correlation to gas temperature distribution. This is caused by Rossby
										waves because of the rotation of the exoplanet featuring hot and cold spots in the
										atmosphere.

									<p> This bachelor thesis studied how a simplification of
											the nucleation process for TiO2 is affecting the formation of CCNs. For
											this purpose, a closed kinetic nucleation approach was used, making several assump-
											tions. TiO2, being highly reactive and relatively easy to model, was chosen to be
											the only nucleation species. The cluster formation was studied for a homomolecular
											polymer growth up to a maximum size of N = 10 and for the temperature range of
											effective TiO2-cluster formation T = 400, . . . , 1000 K.
											Reduced networks show a shift of a few hours in time in the first simulation days and
											a shift in the magnitude of nCP , after it converged to a constant value. In order to
											minimize these shifts, four of the least deviating networks were combined to create
											11 new networks using 12 to 24 reactions. It was achieved to keep the shift in the
											long-term magnitude below 0.02 for all temperatures using a combined network
											of 18 reactions. Thus, simplifications in the cluster
											formation process can be performed with low effects on the long-term values of nCP .
											In contrast, time shifts are connected with the number of reactions and therefore the
											computational costs.

									<p>This report investigates the size dependence of cloud particles advecting in a Hot Jupiter
									atmosphere and the behaviour of cloud particles (of varying sizes) based on the initial conditions
									of the cloud particle system using Hot Jupiter GCM simulations. Depending on the sensitivity
									degree of the initial conditions of the system, the system can be termed as chaotic if the
									Lyapunov exponent is a positive integer. We calculate the drag force of the gas particle and
									the equilibrium drift velocity of the cloud particle for a given set of cloud particle radii using
									hydrodynamic equations. We, then, obtain Lyapunov spectra between the same set of cloud
									particle radii and find that the system shows a small chaotic behaviour. A correlation between
									the results can be established using Pearson’s correlation method. Understanding the degree of
									chaos in a cloud particle system being advected in Hot Jupiters can help us model turbulence
									in climate and atmosphere models of Hot Jupiters more accurately.</p>

										<p>Exoplanet transits have proven to be a powerful tool to detect exoplanets. With ever better instrumentation, we start to get more insides into their atmospheres. One important factor in the observations are clouds. Their large opacities in the visible wavelengths mute most atomic and molecular lines. Therefore, understanding how clouds impact observations is crucial to understanding observations. In Hot Jupiters, the cold night side are typically cloudy whereas the hot day sides are mostly cloud free. This uneven cloud coverage combined with their strong equatorial winds result in observations where half of the exoplanet is observed cloudy and the other half cloud free.<br />
										   In this project, the student modeled the effect of asymmetric exoplanet atmospheres on transit observations. The model was used to produce observation simulation including error bars for state-of-the-art instrumentation. </p>

									<p>On Earth, the greenhouse effect is well known and the leading cause of global warming. Sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere mostly unhindered and heats our planet. Similarly, the Earth radiates heat into outer space but at longer wavelengths. Unfortunately, the same atmospheric gases that are transparent for sunlight are opaque for Earth's heat radiation (see figure 1). The radiation gets absorbed by the atmosphere and is partially re-emitted back to the ground thus trapping the heat and raising Earth's temperature. In addition to the gas, clouds are obscuring the atmosphere and influence the local and global temperature of planets. Even though the greenhouse effect is bad for us, it can be favourable for exoplanets. The increased temperature caused by greenhouse effects can help to keep an otherwise cold planet warm enough for liquid water to exist. This includes planets outside the habitable zone which is defined as the orbital distance from a star at which the net radiation results in temperatures between the freezing and evaporation point of water (without taking the planets atmosphere into account).<br />
										In this project, the goal is to develop a model to computationally study the greenhouse effect caused by exoplanet clouds and atmosphere using a 5 layer computational model. Looking at Venus with only an atmosphere (no clouds), a Greenhouse factor smaller than unity is calculated. This would mean a cooler surface on Venus. However, this cooling is not persent in Venus. This leads to the conclusion that the model is too simplified and needs to be expended for accurate predictions.</p>

									<p>In the last decades over 4000 exoplanets have been discovered. Most of them by indirect measurements (like transits or radial velocity) but some were directly imaged. To observe exoplanets with high contrast imaging, state-of-the-art technology is required to overcome the two main challenges: high angular resolution and high contrast. One example of such an instrument is the Very Large Telescope (VLT) equipped with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch (SPHERE). But telescopes alone are not sufficient to find the very faint exoplanets and advanced image processing techniques have to be developed and constantly improved. The python package PynPoint contains such processing techniques to analyse observations of SPHERE. One of the core functionalities implemented into PynPoint is angular differential imaging (ADI) which helps to reduce the brightness of the host star and reveal faint companions. Recently, PynPoint was updated and now supports SPHERE/IFS data which allows to process spectral observations through spectral differential imaging (SDI). This additional information can help to improve current techniques and can be used to characterize exoplanets.<br />
										In this research angular differential imaging (ADI), spectral differential imaging (SDI) and the combinations of both methods were applied on 3 different systems using principal component analysis. This analysis gives the opporunity to subtract certain information of our data with the use of principal components. The results show that the signal to noise ratio is consistenly bigger with the combination of ADI and SDI than the methods itself. With the information of the position of the planet, properties of the orbit if the planet could me examined. These results match the values of literature, which indicates that the detection went well.</p>

									<p>Optical and telescopic technology is coupled with software and computational coding to make the best images. Here, we have investigated

									Spectral Differential Imaging (SDI), Angular-Spectral Differential Imaging (ASDI), Spectral-Angular Differential Imaging (SADI),
									and Combined Differential Imaging (CODI). All of these can be coupled with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which can help further
									simplify and reduce the large amount of data available. </br></br>

									Though the results are best seen graphically and require more than a few words to describe accurately, we can generalize or simplify
									the results by saying that using more complex data reduction tools (ASDI, SADI, and CODI) allows for better contrast between a host star
									and its observed exoplanet. This is further improved by the use of small, but not unary PCAs in the various reductions.

									<p>Machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool if used correctly. The first computational models using neural networks were developed in the 1940s. Since then, the field of machine learning has steadily grown and today’s algorithms are highly advanced but also incredibly complicated. Therefore, one has to be careful applying them because each algorithm has its pros and cons. In astrophysics, the power of machine learning is slowly being discovered and machine learning is more and more used for tasks which are otherwise difficult to solve. One such task is the calculation of cloud particle opacities. Even though the calculation is well studied, it takes a long time to get precise results. Currently, linear approximations and grid interpola- tions are used to overcome this problem, but as cloud opacity calculations are non-linear, their precision is limited. Fortunately, machine learning might be able to help. Neural networks, for example, have the ability to learn non-linear dependencies and thus can predict values of non-linear functions precisely and fast.<br />
										The potential of ML (machine learning) in accelerating Mie scattering codes is researched, for the particular application of calculating radiative feedback in exoplanet atmospherers. Mie scattering theory describes the interaction between electromagnetic plane waves and particles of micro- scopic size. This model plays a role in a larger scheme to understand atmospheric exoplanet data measured during transit.</p>

										the exhibition take the role of these explorers and discover a new world. </br></br>

										My part during this play was a lecture about exoplanet climates at the very end of the play. In my talk, I told

										Together with Pieter Steyart and Jesper Bruun, I was part of the experimental LARP (Life Action

										the first human colony outside the Solar System. The participants than needed to decide which plant
										to built their first colony on, how to approach the planet, and how they wanted to govern the future

										It was fascinating to see, how a divers group of people interacted with scientific data, how they
										approached the tasks, and get immersed in the story. Especially in the Q&A session afterwards, the

									<p> Teach the Teachers is a series of talks for teachers given by exoplanet scientiests. The goal is to give the
									teachers a glimbs into current astrophysics reasearch and to show the relevence of this topics for their class room.
									The first lesson is on cloud formation. Students can gather first-hand experience by creating their own clouds using
									simple household items such as a jar, soap, ice, hot water and hairspray. Thanks to the detailed descriptions
									developed by Oriel, the students can easily connect their lab work to real cloud formation on our and other planets.
									The second lesson she designed is focused around lighting. Similar to the first one, students learn difficult physical
									process by experimenting with simple household items.
									</br></br>
										In the first presentation, Oriel Marshall, Helena Lecoq, Aaron Schneider and I presented a general overview of
										astrophysics to a group of teachers. We also gave a more detailed view of our individual research topics to show
										them what contemporary exoplanet science looks like. It was amazing to see the fascination of teachers for space and
										exoplanets. Their questions went well beyond the topics we covered in the presentation and showed their vested interest.
									</br></br>
										After a year of hard work, Oriel Marshall has created teaching materials built on the research topics of the CHAMELEON Network.
										One of the main strengths of the CHAMELEON Network is the combination of not only physics research but extending to arts and education.
										I had the pleasure to help Oriel develop the cloud formation lessons and present it to teachers who can then test it in a
										real classroom setting. With this presentation, Oriel introduced the teachers to the lessons, and I presented the current
										state of exoplanet cloud formation. It was fascinating to see once more that teachers are as curious and filled with questions as
										their students.   </p>

									<p> Oriel Marshall is presenting her work to a group of teachers to motivate them to use her newly developed cloud formation lessons. To show the roots of her lessons in current exoplanetary research, Nanna Bach-M&oslash;ller and I present our current work. Nanna is presented recent aerosol experiments which she conducted in the laboratory of the University of Copenhagen. I presented the basics of 3D exoplanet climate modelling and why it is important to know about their clouds.<br />
									    Seeing the motivation of teachers to learn about new scientific concepts and their eager to add it to an already pack-full curriculum is inspiring.

									<p>Here on Earth, weather is one of the most important small talk topics, but what would we talk about if we were on an exoplanet? Thanks to state-of-the-art instrumentation and advanced modelling, we are beginning to understand the fascinating diversity of weather on planets outside of our own solar system.
										<br />Exoplanet surveys like Kepler have discovere<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW19Jdv1E_E" target="_blank">d thousands of exoplanets, meaning, we are now aware of the large diversity of exoplanets that exist in our galaxy. The next step is now to characterise these exoplanets. With current state-of-the-art technology, we are already starting to gain insights into their atmospheres, and with upcoming instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we hope to deepen our understanding of these alien worlds.
										<br />Some of the most fascinating objects discovered so far are Hot Jupiters: planets the size of Jupiter but with orbital periods of just days. These giant gas planets are tidally locked, which results in permanent day and permanent night sides. The temperature, winds and clouds on these planets are nothing like what we know from planets within our solar system and understanding them is the first step to understanding the diverse atmospheres of exoplanets.</p>
