						<p> Exoplanets exhibit a fascinating diversity: from small, rocky worlds to giant gaseous planets.
								We are only beginning to understand their formation, atmospheres and climates, but we already have to admit that
								the galaxy harbors much more diversity than we know from our own solar system. <!-- TODO txt -->
								<br /><br />
								With my work, I want to deepen our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. I'm especially interested in cloud
								formation, the interaction between gas phase and cloud chemistry, and the impact of clouds on the climate of exoplanets.
								To combine clouds and climate, I use the global circulation model (GCM)
								<a href="https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">MITgcm</a> which I combine with disequilibrium
								chemistry and kinetic nucleation.</p>

										<p>Recent observations bear evidence of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres. Large cloud opacities, especially in the visible wavelength
											range, impact the observed spectra by obscuring many atomic and molecular lines. Therefore, understanding cloud formation in
											exoplanet atmospheres is crucial to accurately model the observations. Kinetic nucleation is the first step of cloud formation
											in gaseous exoplanet atmospheres in which smaller clusters collide to build bigger ones. In this work, we derive the disassociation
											rate of clusters from first principal including thermal non equilibrium. We use our model to simulate titania (TiO2) nucleation.
											Our results show, that thermal non-equilibrium can play an important role in dilute environments. Exoplanet atmosphers on the
											other hand are dense enough to justify the assumption of thermal equilibrium. <br /></p>

										<p> In this paper, the potential detection of a nonmonotonic radial rotation profile in a low-mass lower giant star is reported. For most low- and intermediate-mass stars, the rotation on the main sequence seems to be close to rigid. KIC 9267654 however, seems to show a surface rotation rate that is faster than its bulk envelope rotation rate. <br />
											While doing service observation with HERMES at the Mercator telescope, observers can use 10% of the telescope time for their own observation. During one of my runs, I used my time to observe KIC 9267654. </p>

										lecture "Rock around the Moon", take part in a panel discussion on science communication and bond with the
										other participants on excursions to castles, hikes and on whisky tours. Meeting so many engaged and talented

										of these questions.<!-- TODO txt --> Our project was titled <cite>"Planets IN Extra-galactic Areas Providing Population Levels:

										science question and that PINEAPPLE would be a way to answer it.<br />
									    On the practical side, the workshop featured a range of talks and a hands-on session. We learned about
										<cite>"The Real World of Space Missions"</cite> from Peter Roelfsema, about <cite>"The Path to Habitable Worlds"</cite>
										from Aki Roberge, about HabEx and LIFE from Pieter de Visser and about METIS from Bernhard Brandl. In the

								<h3>GCMtoolKit</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/research/GCMT_logo.jpg" alt="GCMtoolkit logo" /></span></p>
								<p> Aaron Schneider, Robin Bayens, and I started developing
									<a href="https://github.com/exorad/GCMtools" target="_blank">GCMtoolKit</a> to simplify working with
									global circulation model (GCM) data. This library should allow to easily perform data handling,<!-- TODO txt -->
									data manipulation, and plotting of GCM output. Starting from MITgcm, the goal is to
									support multiple GCMs, making the library a universal tool for the GCM community.<br />Are you also working with a GCM and would like to add it to our library? Please feel free to <a href="mailto:kiefersv.mail@gmail.com">get in touch</a> with us so that
									you too can profit from GCMtoolKit. </p>

								<h3>Spectral characterization of companions around Young Suns (Master Thesis)</h3>

								<p> Even though direct imaging detection only gave us a handful of planets, they are crucial to study exoplanet<!-- TODO txt -->
									characteristics. For my <a href="docs/MSC_Sven_Kiefer.pdf" target="_blank">Master Thesis</a>, I collaborated with
									the Leiden Observatory which hosted me for half a
									year. The aim was to utilise the spectral information available within
									SPHERE/IFS observation to improve the quality of direct imaging. To this end, we tested and implemented 4
									different spectral differential imaging (SDI) techniques into
									<a href="https://pynpoint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">PynPoint</a>. Furthermore, we looked
									into ways to distinguish background stars from exoplanets. The results of this work have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05278v1.pdf" target="_blank">published</a>.</p>

								<h3>Implementation and Improvement of an MCP anode (Semester Project)</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/research/mcp_annode.jpeg" alt="MCP anode which was tested by Sven Kiefer during his semester project." /></span></p>
								<p> Measuring fundamental particles is no easy task. Previous to this work, an MCP anode had been designed to
									detect the number and position of positrons. <!-- TODO txt -->In this project, we tested the and in 3 different set ups. These
									tests showed a critical design flaw in the anode. The currents within the anode after a positron
									impact can damage the thin carbon layer of the anode. To prepare future improvements of the anode, we performed
									simulations to calculate the maximum currents that can occur within the anode. The simulations also showed that
									it is difficult to balance precise position determination and robustness to strong currents.

								<h3>To Measure a Transit with a 0.5m Telescope (Semester Project)</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/research/TRES3B_predict.jpg" alt="Transit curve of TrEs-3 b measured by Sven Kiefer during his Bachelor thesis." /></span></p>
								<p> Every astronomer living in a big city knows the frustration of starless skies. In this project, we aimed to determine whether an exoplanetary transit can be measured in the middle of Zurich with the 0.5m Telescope at Hoengerberg.
									Collaborating with Adrian Gheorghe, we developed Python routines to accurately measure the brightness of stars.
									During a period of 6 months, we conducted 6 observation of stars with known Hot Jupiter transits. In the
									end, we were able to extract two reasonable transit light curves. One of these was later used in a follow up
									study to confirm the exoplanetary transit.
