						<p> Exoplanets exhibit a fascinating diversity: from small, rocky worlds to giant gaseous planets.
								We are only beginning to understand their formation, atmospheres and climates, but we already have to admit that
								the galaxy harbors much more diversity than we know from our own solar system. <!-- TODO txt -->
								<br /><br />
								With my work, I want to deepen our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres. I'm especially interested in cloud
								formation, the interaction between gas phase and cloud chemistry, and the impact of clouds on the climate of exoplanets.
								To combine clouds and climate, I use the global circulation model (GCM)
								<a href="https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">MITgcm</a> which I combine with disequilibrium
								chemistry and kinetic nucleation.</p>

										<p>Recent observations suggest the presence of clouds in exoplanet atmospheres but have also shown
											that certain chemical species in the upper atmosphere might not be in chemical equilibrium.
											Present and future interpretation of data from, for example, CHEOPS, JWST, PLATO and Ariel requires
											a combined understanding of the gas-phase and the cloud chemistry. The goal of this work is to
											calculate the two main cloud formation processes, nucleation and bulk growth, consistently from a
											non-equilibrium gas-phase. The aim is further to explore the interaction between a kinetic gas-phase
											and cloud micro-physics. The cloud formation is modelled using the moment method and kinetic nucleation
											which are coupled to a gas-phase kinetic rate network. Specifically, the formation of cloud condensation
											nuclei is derived from cluster rates that include the thermochemical data of (TiO2)N from N = 1 to 15.
											The surface growth of 9 bulk Al/Fe/Mg/O/Si/S/Ti binding materials considers the respective gas-phase
											species through condensation and surface reactions as derived from kinetic disequilibrium. The effect
											of completeness of rate networks and the time evolution of the cloud particle formation is studied
											for an example exoplanet HD 209458 b. A consistent, fully time-dependent cloud formation model in
											chemical disequilibrium with respect to nucleation, bulk growth and the gas-phase is presented and
											first test cases are studied. This model shows that cloud formation in exoplanet atmospheres is a
											fast process. This confirms previous findings that the formation of cloud particles is a local
											process. Tests on selected locations within the atmosphere of the gas-giant HD 209458 b show that
											the cloud particle number density and volume reach constant values within 1s. The complex kinetic
											polymer nucleation of TiO2 confirms results from classical nucleation models. The surface
											reactions of SiO[s] and SiO2[s] can create a catalytic cycle that dissociates H2 to 2 H, resulting
											in a reduction of the CH$_4$ number densities.  <br /></p>

										<p>Nucleation is considered to be the first step in dust and cloud formation in the atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch
										(AGB) stars, exoplanets, and brown dwarfs. In these environments dust and cloud particles grow to macroscopic sizes when
										gas phase species condense onto cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs). Understanding the formation processes of CCNs and dust
										in AGB stars is important because the species that formed in their outflows enrich the interstellar medium. Although widely
										used, the validity of chemical and thermal equilibrium conditions is debatable in some of these highly dynamical astrophysical
										environments. We aim to derive a kinetic nucleation model that includes the effects of thermal non-equilibrium by adopting different
										temperatures for nucleating species, and to quantify the impact of thermal non-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation. Forward and backward
										 rate coefficients are derived as part of a collisional kinetic nucleation theory ansatz. The endothermic backward rates are
										 derived from the law of mass action in thermal non-equilibrium. We consider elastic collisions as thermal equilibrium drivers.
										 For homogeneous TiO2 nucleation and a gas temperature of 1250 K, we find that differences in the kinetic cluster temperatures
										 as small as 20 K increase the formation of larger TiO2 clusters by over an order of magnitude. An increase in cluster temperature
										 of around 20 K at gas temperatures of 1000 K can reduce the formation of a larger TiO2 cluster by over an order of magnitude. Our
										 results confirm and quantify the prediction of previous thermal non-equilibrium studies. Small thermal non-equilibria can cause a
										 significant change in the synthesis of larger clusters. Therefore, it is important to use kinetic nucleation models that include thermal
										 non-equilibrium to describe the formation of clusters in environments where even small thermal non-equilibria can be present.  <br /></p>

										<p> In this paper, the potential detection of a nonmonotonic radial rotation profile in a low-mass lower giant star is reported. For most low- and intermediate-mass stars, the rotation on the main sequence seems to be close to rigid. KIC 9267654 however, seems to show a surface rotation rate that is faster than its bulk envelope rotation rate. <br />

For Cloud Academy, many of the big and small names assemble in Les Houches for a week of all things clouds. From observations to theory, from exoplanets to brown dwarfs, many different topics were represented. With around 60 attendees, Cloud Academy was small enough to allow for in depth discussions with many different scientists, leading to fruitfull idiations and hopefully future collaborations.
                                    </br> Druing the week in Les Houchs, I presented my work on the effect of thermal non-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation.

									forces to study exoplanet atmospheres. With our combined expertise, we are able to model the temperature, wind, and

								<h3>GCMtoolKit</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/research/GCMT_logo.jpg" alt="GCMtoolkit logo" /></span></p>
								<p> Aaron Schneider, Robin Bayens, and I started developing
									<a href="https://github.com/exorad/GCMtools" target="_blank">GCMtoolKit</a> to simplify working with
									global circulation model (GCM) data. This library should allow to easily perform data handling,<!-- TODO txt -->
									data manipulation, and plotting of GCM output. Starting from MITgcm, the goal is to
									support multiple GCMs, making the library a universal tool for the GCM community.<br />Are you also working with a GCM and would like to add it to our library? Please feel free to <a href="mailto:kiefersv.mail@gmail.com">get in touch</a> with us so that
									you too can profit from GCMtoolKit. </p>

								<h3>Spectral characterization of companions around Young Suns (Master Thesis)</h3>

										<span class="image left"><img src="IMG/research/51eridani.jpg" alt="Processed direct imaging data of 51 Eridani b." /></span></p>
									</a>
								<p> Even though direct imaging detection only gave us a handful of planets, they are crucial to study exoplanet<!-- TODO txt -->
									characteristics. For my <a href="docs/MSC_Sven_Kiefer.pdf" target="_blank">Master Thesis</a>, I collaborated with
									the Leiden Observatory which hosted me for half a
									year. The aim was to utilise the spectral information available within
									SPHERE/IFS observation to improve the quality of direct imaging. To this end, we tested and implemented 4
									different spectral differential imaging (SDI) techniques into
									<a href="https://pynpoint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">PynPoint</a>. Furthermore, we looked
									into ways to distinguish background stars from exoplanets. The results of this work have been <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05278v1.pdf" target="_blank">published</a>.</p>

								<h3>Implementation and Improvement of an MCP anode (Semester Project)</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/research/mcp_annode.jpeg" alt="MCP anode which was tested by Sven Kiefer during his semester project." /></span></p>
								<p> Measuring fundamental particles is no easy task. Previous to this work, an MCP anode had been designed to
									detect the number and position of positrons. <a href="docs/PSA_Report.pdf" target="_blank">In this project</a>, we tested the and in 3 different set ups. These
									tests showed a critical design flaw in the anode. The currents within the anode after a positron
									impact can damage the thin carbon layer of the anode. To prepare future improvements of the anode, we performed
									simulations to calculate the maximum currents that can occur within the anode. The simulations also showed that
									it is difficult to balance precise position determination and robustness to strong currents.

								<h3>To Measure a Transit with a 0.5m Telescope (Semester Project)</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="IMG/research/TRES3B_predict.jpg" alt="Transit curve of TrEs-3 b measured by Sven Kiefer during his Bachelor thesis." /></span></p>
								<p> Every astronomer living in a big city knows the frustration of starless skies. <a href="docs/Tranist_Thesis_Sven_Kiefer.pdf" target="_blank">In this project</a>,
								    we aimed to determine whether an exoplanetary transit
								    can be measured in the middle of Zurich with the 0.5m Telescope at Hoengerberg.
									Collaborating with Adrian Gheorghe, we developed Python routines to accurately measure the brightness of stars.
									During a period of 6 months, we conducted 6 observation of stars with known Hot Jupiter transits. In the
									end, we were able to extract two reasonable transit light curves. One of these was later used in a follow up
									study to confirm the exoplanetary transit.
