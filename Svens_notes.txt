Text: We combine angular differnetial imaging (ADI) with spectral differential imaging (SDI) to investigate 3 different imaging techniques for spectral direct imaging: ASDI, SADI and CODI. Using SPHERE/IFS observations we test the techniques on Beta Pictoris b, 51 Eridani b and HR 8799 e. Our results show that combining SDI with ADI in general can help and that CODI achieves overall the best results.<br />
