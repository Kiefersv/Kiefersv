allg:
- navigation responsive
- copyright (responsive -> php?), add icons
- news  -> top of every page with teaser on index?
- where add quote? The curious mind will find questions where answers were expected
- html head + favicon
- color landscape
- change dropdowns/collapsibles + alternative for first author paper (hervorheben)
- E-Mail spam protect

- add links to icons etc.

- check: buy domain - url=? pricing, sec, etc.

- later: nav with submenus?
- later: printable
- later: add game, in index or general
- later: pallax?
- later: include html -> for ex with php or javascript (so that texts only once for multiple sites -> how is with SEO?)

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_include.asp
- dark mode definieren
<!-- padding rechts links wie ca. bei 50% -->


index:
- image responsive, wide

- later: revise and reduce text
- later: SM/SEO txts


research:
- Text about Current Research + Research Interest, goals
- conferences
- collaborations
- Research Projects
	-> tbd new projects like PI etc
	-> currently: msc & bsc projects (thesis), evt. from practical exp.  -->  1+ image, txt, link or doc
- github?


teaching & outreach
- current projects
- list of projects --> dropdown incl. short text & download report
- courses taught
- Outreach -> mini-blog about outreach

extra-curricular activities
- use blog teaser -> new site

- later: automatically display other blog teasers on detail site (under detail blog)


ideas:
- good server -> self-hosted, github implementation dort verknüpfen
- code hosting on webpage



Notes:

"About” or “Home” page along with a page for your C.V. (w/ links!), another for Publications, and another for Teaching Materials.

blog, pages for any digital projects you might be working on, and connections to social media sites -> social media yap, rest nope

avoid posting your email address directly on your site (and be sure to remove it from your C.V.) as there’s a good chance that it will get picked up by spam bots and inundate your inbox. -> spam protect!

where conferences, collaborations etc? -> research/science/teaching? -> teaching & projects?
research projects // teaching // code // About me / CV // evt. hobbies etc

showcase things outside normal application package
